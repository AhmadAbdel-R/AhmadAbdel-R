# 👋 Hi, I’m @AhmadAbdel-R

🎓 I'm a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Windsor with a passion for embedded systems, firmware development, and hardware design.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Low-level firmware development (bare-metal & RTOS)
- PCB design & prototyping
- 3D printing custom enclosures and parts
- Power electronics & embedded hardware
- Microcontrollers (ESP32, ATtiny, STM32, SAMD21, etc.)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced C/C++ for embedded systems
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- RF communication & low-level UART/SPI/I2C protocols
- Python scripting for automation

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source embedded projects
- Custom PCB and hardware builds
- Firmware for IoT devices and robotics

## 💻 Tools & Software I use:
- **VS Code + PlatformIO** (my main dev environment)
- **Fusion 360** for PCB design and 3D modeling
- Cura for 3D printing
- Arduino IDE, STM32CubeIDE, MPLAB X
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📫 How to reach me:
- Email: ahmad.abdelraheem.dev@gmail.com
- LinkedIn: [Ahmad Abdel-Raheem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-abdel-raheem)


## ⚡ Fun fact:
I’ve designed and built over a dozen custom PCBs — and I still get excited every time I hear the soldering iron click on.
